Google Cloud Vision API Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Vision API. [Google Cloud Vision API][0] allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

Authentication is typically done through [Application Default Credentials][11],
which means you do not have to change the code to authenticate as long as
your environment has credentials. You have a few options for setting up
authentication:

#. When running locally, use the [Google Cloud SDK][12]

    .. code-block:: bash

        gcloud beta auth application-default login


#. When running on App Engine or Compute Engine, credentials are already
   set-up. However, you may need to configure your Compute Engine instance
   with [additional scopes][13].

#. You can create a `Service Account key file`_. This file can be used to
   authenticate to Google Cloud Platform services from any environment. To use
   the file, set the ``GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`` environment variable to
   the path to the key file, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service_account.json

Install Dependencies
++++++++++++++++++++

#. Install [pip][21] and [virtualenv][22] if you do not already have them.

#. Create a virtualenv. Samples are compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.4+.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ virtualenv env
        $ source env/bin/activate

#. Install the dependencies needed to run the samples.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Quickstart
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python quickstart.py


Detect
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python detect.py

    usage: detect.py [-h]
                     {faces,faces-uri,labels,labels-uri,landmarks,landmarks-uri,text,text-uri,logos,logos-uri,safe-search,safe-search-uri,properties,properties-uri,web,web-uri,crophints,crophints-uri,fulltext,fulltext-uri}
                     ...

    This application demonstrates how to perform basic operations with the
    Google Cloud Vision API.

    Example Usage:
    python detect.py text ./resources/wakeupcat.jpg
    python detect.py labels ./resources/landmark.jpg
    python detect.py web ./resources/landmark.jpg
    python detect.py web-uri http://wheresgus.com/dog.JPG
    python detect.py faces-uri gs://your-bucket/file.jpg
